    SQL JOINS are used to combine data across multiple entities in a relational
    database. In this article, I will explain JOINS through real world
    examples and plain English.

When working with a normalized SQL database, you’re often left with disjointed
data spread across multiple tables. Since these individual datum tend not to
carry a lot of weight when viewed in isolation, we have to reunite the disparate
pieces. One of the most ubiquitous, performant ways to coalesce this data is
through Join.

Join is used to combine data from multiple entities in a relational database.
ANSI SQL defines 5 Joins. They are:
- Inner Join
- Left Outer Join
- Right Outer Join
- Full Outer Join
- Cross Join

## INNER JOIN
An **INNER JOIN** returns a set of relations where attributes of the first table
are combined with attributes of the second, given the relations satisfy a join
predicate. That is, tables are combined when they share a common identifying attribute.

#### Syntax
{% highlight sql %}
SELECT [COLUMNS]
FROM table_1
INNER JOIN table_2
ON table_1.analagous_column = table_2.analagous_column;
{% endhighlight %}

or

{% highlight sql %}
SELECT [COLUMNS]
FROM table_1, table_2
ON table_1.analagous_column = table_2.analagous_column;
{% endhighlight %}

#### Example
Consider the following tables:

**staff**

| staff_num | staff_name |
|-|-|
| 123 | John Doe |
| 456 | Jane Doe |
| 789 | Robert Fakename |

**project_staff**

| project_num | staff_num |
|-|-|
| 12345 | 123 |
| 12345 | 456 |
| 67890 | 123 |
| 13579 | 456 |
| 13579 | 789 |
| 13579 | 123 |
| 24680 | 789 |
| 24680 | 456 |

If we were to use an **INNER JOIN** to combine these tables, the query would look
something like this:

{% highlight sql %}
SELECT project_staff.project_num, staff.staff_num, staff.staff_name
FROM staff, project_staff
ON project_staff.staff_num = staff.staff_num;
{% endhighlight %}

The query would return the following result set:

| project_staff.project_num | staff.staff_num | staff.staff_name |
|-|-|-|
| 12345 | 123 | John Doe |
| 12345 | 456 | Jane Doe |
| 67890 | 123 | John Doe |
| 3579 | 456 | Jane Doe |
| 13579 | 789 | Robert Fakename |
| 13579 | 123 | John Doe |
| 24680 | 789 | Robert Fakename |
| 24680 | 456 | Jane Doe |

## LEFT OUTER JOIN
A **LEFT OUTER JOIN** returns a set of relations where attributes from every relation
in the first table are combined with attributes of the second, given the relations
in the second satisfy a join predicate. In other words, everything from the
first table is returned, along with stuff from the second table, so long as the
tables share a common identifying attribute.

#### Syntax
{% highlight sql %}
SELECT [COLUMNS]
FROM table_1
LEFT OUTER JOIN table_2
ON table_1.analagous_column = table_2.analagous_column;
{% endhighlight %}

#### Example
Consider the following tables:

**staff**

| staff_num | staff_name |
|-|-|
| 123 | John Doe |
| 456 | Jane Doe |
| 789 | Robert Fakename |

**project_staff**

| project_num | staff_num |
|-|-|
| 12345 | 123 |
| 12345 | 456 |
| 67890 | 123 |
| 13579 | 456 |
| 13579 | 789 |
| 13579 | 123 |
| 24680 | 789 |
| 24680 | 456 |
| 86420 | NULL |
| 97531 | NULL |

A **LEFT OUTER JOIN** of `project_staff` and `staff` would look like this:

{% highlight sql %}
SELECT project_staff.project_num, staff.staff_num, staff.staff_name
FROM staff
LEFT OUTER JOIN project_staff
ON project_staff.staff_num = staff.staff_num;
{% endhighlight %}

… and would yield this:

| project_staff.project_num | staff.staff_num | staff.staff_name |
|-|-|-|
| 12345 | 123 | John Doe |
| 12345 | 456 | Jane Doe |
| 67890 | 123 | John Doe |
| 13579 | 456 | Jane Doe |
| 13579 | 789 | Robert Fakename |
| 13579 | 123 | John Doe |
| 24680 | 789 | Robert Fakename |
| 24680 | 456 | Jane Doe |
| 86420 | NULL | NULL |
| 97531 | NULL | NULL |

## RIGHT OUTER JOIN
A **RIGHT OUTER JOIN** mimics the behavior of a **LEFT OUTER JOIN**, except the
tables are reversed. It returns a set of relations where attributes satisfying a 
join predicate from the first table are combined with every relation in the 
second table. In other words, matching records from the first table are
combined with all records from the second.

#### Syntax
{% highlight sql %}
SELECT [COLUMNS]
FROM table_1
RIGHT OUTER JOIN table_2
ON table_1.analagous_column = table_2.analagous_column;
{% endhighlight %}

#### Example
For demonstration purposes, consider the following tables:

**staff**

| staff_num | staff_name |
|-|-|
| 123 | John Doe |
| 456 | Jane Doe |
| 789 | Robert Fakename |
| 555 | Bobby Tables |

**project_staff**

| project_num | staff_num |
|-|-|
| 12345 | 123 |
| 12345 | 456 |
| 67890 | 123 |
| 13579 | 456 |
| 13579 | 789 |
| 13579 | 123 |
| 24680 | 789 |
| 24680 | 456 |

A **RIGHT OUTER JOIN** to combine the tables would look like this:

{% highlight sql %}
SELECT project_staff.project_num, staff.staff_num, staff.staff_name
FROM staff
RIGHT OUTER JOIN project_staff
ON project_staff.staff_num = staff.staff_num;
{% endhighlight %}

Yielding this as a result set:

| project_staff.project_num | staff.staff_num | staff.staff_name |
|-|-|-|
| 12345 |123 | John Doe |
| 12345 |456 | Jane Doe |
| 67890 |123 | John Doe |
| 13579 |456 | Jane Doe |
| 13579 |789 | Robert Fakename |
| 13579 |123 | John Doe |
| 24680 |789 | Robert Fakename |
| 24680 |456 | Jane Doe |
| NULL |555 | Bobby Tables |

## FULL OUTER JOIN
A **FULL OUTER JOIN** returns a set of relations where attributes from every
record in both left and right tables are returned. Conceptually, this combines
**LEFT OUTER JOIN** and **RIGHT OUTER JOIN** functionality. Matching records
mimic **INNER JOIN**. In other words, every record from the each table is
returned, regardless of completion.

#### Syntax
{% highlight sql %}
SELECT [COLUMNS]
FROM table_1
FULL OUTER JOIN table_2
ON table_1.analagous_column = table_2.analagous_column;
{% endhighlight %}

#### Example
Consider the following tables:

**staff**

| staff_num | staff_name |
|-|-|
| 123 | John Doe |
| 456 | Jane Doe |
| 789 | Robert Fakename |
| 555 | Bobby Tables |

**project_staff**

| project_num | staff_num |
|-|-|
| 12345 | 123 |
| 12345 | 456 |
| 67890 | 123 |
| 13579 | 456 |
| 13579 | 789 |
| 13579 | 123 |
| 24680 | 789 |
| 24680 | 456 |
| 86420 | NULL |
| 97531 | NULL |

**FULL OUTER JOIN** of `project_staff` and `staff` would take this shape:

{% highlight sql %}
SELECT project_staff.project_num, staff.staff_num, staff.staff_name
FROM staff
FULL OUTER JOIN project_staff
ON project_staff.staff_num = staff.staff_num;
{% endhighlight %}

It would return results like this:

| project_staff.project_num | staff.staff_num | staff.staff_name |
|-|-|-|
| 12345 | 123 | John Doe |
| 12345 | 456 | Jane Doe |
| 67890 | 123 | John Doe |
| 13579 | 456 | Jane Doe |
| 13579 | 789 | Robert Fakename |
| 13579 | 123 | John Doe |
| 24680 | 789 | Robert Fakename |
| 24680 | 456 | Jane Doe |
| 86420 | NULL | NULL |
| 97531 | NULL | NULL |
| NULL  | 555 | Bobby Tables |

## CROSS JOIN
A **CROSS JOIN** returns the Cartesian product of rows in the joined relations.
In other words, it produces a table with every row in the first table combined
with every table from the second table.

#### Syntax
{% highlight sql %}
SELECT [COLUMNS]
FROM table_1
CROSS JOIN table_2;
{% endhighlight %}

or

{% highlight sql %}
SELECT [COLUMNS]
FROM table_1, table_1;
{% endhighlight %}

#### Example
Consider the following tables:

**staff**

| staff_num | staff_name |
|-|-|
| 123 | John Doe |
| 456 | Jane Doe |
| 789 | Robert Fakename |

**project_staff**

| project_num | staff_num |
|-|-|
| 12345 | 123 |
| 12345 | 456 |
| 67890 | 123 |
| 13579 | 456 |
| 13579 | 789 |
| 13579 | 123 |
| 24680 | 789 |
| 24680 | 456 |

**CROSS JOIN** of project_staff and staff would look like this:

{% highlight sql %}
SELECT project_staff.project_num, staff.staff_num, staff.staff_name
FROM staff
CROSS JOIN project_staff;
{% endhighlight %}

The query above would yield:

| project_num | staff_num | staff_name |
|-|-|-|
| 12345 | 123 | John Doe |
| 12345 | 456 | John Doe |
| 67890 | 123 | John Doe |
| 13579 | 456 | John Doe |
| 13579 | 789 | John Doe |
| 13579 | 123 | John Doe |
| 24680 | 789 | John Doe |
| 24680 | 456 | John Doe |
| 12345 | 123 | Jane Doe |
| 12345 | 456 | Jane Doe |
| 67890 | 123 | Jane Doe |
| 13579 | 456 | Jane Doe |
| 13579 | 789 | Jane Doe |
| 13579 | 123 | Jane Doe |
| 24680 | 789 | Jane Doe |
| 24680 | 456 | Jane Doe |
| 12345 | 123 | Robert Fakename |
| 12345 | 456 | Robert Fakename |
| 67890 | 123 | Robert Fakename |
| 13579 | 456 | Robert Fakename |
| 13579 | 789 | Robert Fakename |
| 13579 | 123 | Robert Fakename |
| 24680 | 789 | Robert Fakename |
| 24680 | 456 | Robert Fakename |
