title:  "My Journey part 2 - Academic Aspirations (2005 to 2010)"

    In this article, I talk about my first shot at college, my terrible academic
    work ethic, and some side projects that were entirely too distracting.

After I graduated from high school, I did what ever honor roll student did. I
went to college. I enrolled in a local university and began my computer science
studies.

The curriculum was pretty typical for a CS degree. We learned object oriented
programming in Java, data structures and algorithms in C++ and basic networking
(we had a lot of fun sending shutdown signals to classmates' computers). We
learned some HTML and built server-side applications in Perl. I took a few database
classes along the way too, building inventory programs in PL/SQL.

Admittedly, I wasn't a great student. I had a 3.0GPA, but didn't take it
seriously. I rested on my laurels and skated through classes without much effort.
I did well in high school without trying. My bad study habits carried forward into
my collegiate career. I was not proactive. I was not studious. I was not diligent.
I was a little shit.

Instead of dedicating myself to studies, I focused on side projects. I, with some
friends, administered a few forums dedicated to the tuner car subculture. As
mentioned in part 1, I grew to appreciate the culture and community. As a broke
college kid, I couldn't afford my own race car. Instead, I moderated, administered,
and ran messages boards to connect the community. It was the equivalent of my dad'
BBS. It was my contribution to the scene.

When I started running forums, I had a naive "if you build it, they will come"
attitude. At the time (circa 2006), content was king and surreptitious "SEO"
strategies were everywhere. I spent minimal time marketing my product. I didn't
want to run a professional forum; I just wanted a sandbox to play in.

Through the course of forum administration, I found gaps in the product offerings.
I contributed to the open source community (in a world before GitHub) by writing
plugins for Invision Power Board. I even won a "Mod of the Month" award for one
of my contributions. It was a cloud photo sharing modification, before 
"the cloud" was commonplace. I basically invented the cloud.

After a while, I began experimenting with building my own social networks. I rolled
my own Facebook knock-off in PHP, offering profiles, statuses and photo sharing.
The product was niche, also catering to the car subculture. The code never left
my local development environment. Never-the-less, it was a good opportunity to
really learn the ins and outs of software engineering.

Ultimately, I dropped out of college. The 2008 recession rolled around and I was
just not proactive enough to finish. I still regret this, as it set my career
back by about 5 years. Maybe it's for the best though, considering the chain of
events it kicked off. We'll talk more about that in the next installment.
