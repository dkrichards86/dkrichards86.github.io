      For the most part, my hobbyist projects are available on GitHub. Some of my
      more intereting projects are seen below.

              The app was born from an undergraduate capstone project where I proposed
              a solution to a problem, went through the software engineering design
              process, and finally saw the project through a full software development
              life cycle. I revived the project while completing my MBA, addressing
              deficiencies in design and market fit. My intent was to run the open
              source project like a software company. This second phase of work
              was run much more professionally, to include formalized pull request
              processes, code standards, and unit testing. The second version is
              publically available at

            NLP news aggregator
          </h4>
          <div>
            <p>
              The goal of Ticker is to aggregate news, presenting similar topics
              from a variety of perspectives. In theory, this sounds like a great
              idea. In practice howver, RSS feeds were not suitable for naieve,
              rule-based NLP or unsupervised learning. Content is too hard to
              corral and sufficiently group based solely on information provided
              in RSS feeds.

              In 2012, the city of Durham, North Carolina has launched a series
              of social and economic policies with the goal of transforming the
              once crime-ridden city into a vibrant and progressive community.
              Anecdotal evidence suggests the policies have greatly impacted the
              city’s economic landscape. Through statistical rigor, we can
              validate this assertions. Using restaurant openings as a proxy for
              business development, this report intends to measure the efficacy
              of the city’s initiatives.

            Twitter Sentiment Analysis

            A collection and sentiment analysis platform for tweets.

              The Twitter Sentiment Analysis platform combines collection of Tweets,
              analysis of tweets for sentiment, and calculation and display of
              summary stats via a RESTful API into a single platform. This tool was
              the basis for a side project using Twitter sentiment as a proxy for
              presidential approval ratings.
