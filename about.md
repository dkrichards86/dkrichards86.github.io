    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
      In today's tech industry, companies thrive on culture. Employers
      and employees alike strive to find the perfect fit, to assemble 
      the ideal group of personalities. These like personalities will
      bond more easily, will communicate more effectively, and will
      succeed more frequently.

      I have no proof to support these claims. It just sounded 
      good - like something you'd see on a clickbait "8 Tips for Startup
      Success" blog post.

      If you've made it this far, you probably want to know more 
      about me. Without further ado, a little bit about myself:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I'm always trying to learn new things. For the most part, 
        I enjoy it. I appreciate the sense of accomplishment
        that comes when something finally clicks.
      </li>

        I feel like an underdog because my career has followed a
        different path than most of my peers. I feel I have a
        cetrain tenacity that most others don't.
      </li>

        I love working out. I have competed in powerlifting since
        2011. My current meet personal records are 215kg (474lb)
        Squat, 140kg (308lb) Bench Press, 265kg (584lb) Deadlift,
        and 610kg (1343lb) Total. I've been training more like a 
        bodybuilder as of late. Training this way lets me enjoy
        the process without the stress of hitting training weights.

        I spent 5 years (2010 - 2015) in the United States Marine Corps
        as an Arabic Linguist. I deployed in 2013 to United States
        Embassy, Tripoli, Libya as part of an Embassy Reinforcement
        mission, where I served as Senior Linguist and Responsible 
        Officer for our team. I was promoted to the rank of Sergeant
        in August, 2014.
